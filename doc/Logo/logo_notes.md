# The PyDSM logo

The current PyDSM logo contains the PyDSM word typeset in white in the "boron" font over a blue rectangle with rounded corners.

The boron font is a public domain font by [Typodermic
Fonts](https://typodermicfonts.com). It is a MICR inspired retro tech
font with conductive pathways.

At the time when the logo was created, the font was available as
`BORON2.TTF` from the now now defunct Larabie Fonts by Ray Larabie who
released it as freeware. That font file is still available from
[DaFont](https://www.dafontfree.net/), but is also stored here for
archival. The more current otf font reports being the version 3 of the
font and is not metric compatible with the original one.
