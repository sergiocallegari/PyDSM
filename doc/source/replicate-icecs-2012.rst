This section illustrates how to replicate the results presented in the
paper

    Sergio Callegari, Federico Bizzarri *"Should ΔΣ modulators used in
    AC motor drives be adapted to the mechanical load of the motor?"*,
    Proceedings of the 19th IEEE International Conference on
    Electronics, Circuits and Systems (ICECS), 2012, pp. 849 - 852. DOI:

To this aim, some sample code is provided in the directory
``Examples/ICECS-2012``.

The sample code reproduces the plots in Figs. 2 and 4 in the paper.
Furthermore, it outputs tabular data including that in Tables II and III.

With respect to the numeric data, note that the discrete time
simulations of the digital delta sigma modulator include some random
dithering. Thus the numeric data will never be identical to that in the paper.
