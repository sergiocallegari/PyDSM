def partitionABCD(ABCD, m=None):
    u"""Partition ABCD ss description in A, B, C, D for an m-input sytem

    Parameters
    ----------
    ABCD : matrix like 2D
        input ABCD matrix providing the state space representation
    m : int or None, optional
        number of inputs of state space system. If set to None, a guess
        is made from the ABCD matrix size (defaults to None).

    Returns
    -------
    (A, B, C, D) : tuple of 2D ndarrays
        the individual matrices composing ABCD

    Notes
    -----
    When the number of inputs is automatically guessed, the minimum
    acceptable value is take, considering the the system must have at least
    an input and an output.

    If ABCD is an ndarray, then its content is not copied in A, B, C, D.
    """
    ABCD = np.asarray(ABCD)
    if m is None:
        n = min(ABCD.shape)-1
    else:
        n = ABCD.shape[1]-m
    return (ABCD[:n, :n], ABCD[:n, n:], ABCD[n:, :n], ABCD[n:, n:])
