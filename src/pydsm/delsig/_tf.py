def evalTF(tf, x):
    """
    Evaluates a transfer function.

    This function can be used either for discrete time or continuous time
    transfer functions (see the notes).

    Parameters
    ----------
    tf : tuple
        transfer function in zpk or ba form
    x : complex or array_like of complex
        value or vector of values where the tf is to be evaluated

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        value(s) of transfer function at the given complex values.

    Notes
    -----
    Parameter x corresponds to 's' or 'z' in CT or DT transfer functions
    respectively. Thus it should be 1j*omega or exp(1j*omega*T).

    With respect to the tf parameter, zpk form is a triple containing a list
    of zeros, a list of poles and a scalar gain. The ba form (also called tf
    form in the scipy documentation) is a couple containing a list of the
    numerator coefficients and a list of the denominator coefficients. The
    coefficients are sorted from the higher power of 's' or 'z' to the lower,
    so that the last coefficient is in fact the constant term in the
    numerator/denominator polynomial.

def evalRPoly(roots, x, k=1):
    """
    Compute the value of a polynomial that is given in terms of its roots.
    Roots at infinity are removed before the computation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    roots : array_like
        roots of polynomial
    x : complex or array_like of complex
        complex value or vector of complex values where tf is to be
        evaluated
    k -> real, optional
        gain, defaults to 1.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        value of polynomial at the given complex values.
