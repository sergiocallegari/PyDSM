    u"""Synthesize the NTF for a ΔΣM w/ multibit quantizer by the CLANS method.

    This function is based on the CLANS method (Closed-Loop Analysis of Noise
    Shaping Coders) by J. G. Kenney and L. R. Carley, described in
    'Design of Multibit Noise Shaping Data Converters'
    Analog Integrated Circuits and Signal Processing Vol. 3 pp 259-272 (1993).

    The method is only suitable for low pass modulators.

    Parameters
    ----------
    order : int, optional
        the order of the modulator, defaults to 4
    osr : float, optional
        the oversamping ratio (based on the actual signal bandwidth).
        Defaults to 64
    nq : int, optional
        the number of quantization levels, defaults to 5
    rmax : real, optional
        the maximum radius of the NTF poles
    opt : int, optional
        opt parameter passed to ``synthesizeNTF`` which is used to compute the
        NTF zero location and the initial pole location for the optimizer

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    show_progress : bool, optional
        provide extended output, default is False and can be updated by
        changing the function ``default_options`` attribute.
    slsqp_opts : dictionary, optional
        Parameters passed to the ``fmin_slsqp`` optimizer. Allowed options are:

        ``maxiters``
            Maximum number of iterations (defaults to 100)
        ``ftol``
            Precision goal for the value of f in the stopping criterion
            (defaults to 1e-6)
        ``eps``
            Step size used for numerical approximation of the jacobian
            (defaults to 1.4901161193847656e-08)

        Do not use other options since they could break the minimizer in
        unexpected ways. Defaults can
        be set by changing the function ``default_options`` attribute.

    Returns
    -------
    ntf : tuple
        noise transfer function in zpk form.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        'Error. f0 must be less than 0.5' if f0 is out of range

        'Order must be even for a bandpass modulator.' if the order is
        incompatible with the modulator type.

        'The opt vector must be of length xxx' if opt is used to explicitly
        pass the NTF zeros and these are in the wrong number.

    Notes
    -----
    This is actually an adaptation of the CLANS method. In the
    original paper about CLANS, NTF zeros are placed at z=1 (with the
    indication that other placements are possible). Here, the zeros are
    placed where ``synthesizeNTF`` places them.

    The computation is based on a nonlinear, nonlinearly constrained
    optimization. Since the optimizer used here is different from the
    optimizer used in other toolboxes implementing this function,
    the results may differ. The current optimizer is ``SLSQP``.

    The function internally calls ``synthesizeNTF``, and rises the same
    exceptions as ``synthesizeNTF``.
