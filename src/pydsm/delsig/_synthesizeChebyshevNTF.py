def synthesizeChebyshevNTF(order=3, osr=64, opt=0, H_inf=1.5, f0=0.0):
    """
    Synthesize the NTF for a DS modulator by a Chebyshev function.

    This function is an alternative to synthesizeNTF which assumes
    that the magnitude of the denominator of the NTF is approximately constant
    in the passband. When the OSR or H_inf are low, this assumption breaks
    down and synthesizeNTF yields a non-optimal NTF. The synthesizeChebyshevNTF
    creates non-optimal NTFs, but fares better than synthesizeNTF in the
    aforementioned circumstances. The NTF is obtained from a type-2 highpass
    Chebyshev function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    order : int, optional
        the order of the modulator, defaults to 3
    osr : float, optional
        the oversamping ratio (based on the actual signal bandwidth)
    opt : int, optional
        ignored, present for signature compatibility with synthesizeNTF
    H_inf : real, optional
        max allowed peak value of the NTF. Defaults to 1.5
    f0 : real, optional
        center frequency, defaults to 0.
        1 corresponds to the sampling frequency, so that 0.5 is the
        maximum value. Value 0 specifies an LP modulator.

    Returns
    -------
    ntf : tuple
        noise transfer function in zpk form.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        'Order must be even for a bandpass modulator.' if the order is
        incompatible with the modulator type.

    Notes
    -----
    Parameter opt is ignored.
