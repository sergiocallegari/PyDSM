def plotPZ(H, color='b', markersize=5, showlist=False):
    """
    Plots the poles and zeros of a transfer function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    H : tuple
        transfer function in pzk or nd form
    showlist : bool
        if showlist is true, a list of the poles and zeros is superimposed
        onto the plot.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    color : string or list of strings, optional
        color or colors to plot the poles and the zeros (defaults to 'b'
        meaning black)
    markersize : real, optional
        size of the markers used to represent the poles and the zeros
        (defaults to 5)

    Notes
    -----
    See `matplotlib` for info about color codes.
