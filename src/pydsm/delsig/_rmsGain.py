def rmsGain(H, f1, f2, N=100):
    """
    Compute the root-mean-square gain of a DT transfer function.

    The computation is practiced on an assigned frequency interval.
    By root-mean-square, it is meant that the magnitude response of the
    transfer function is squared and averaged over the band of interest.
    Then, the square root of this averaged value is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    H : tuple
        transfer function either in (z,p,k) or (n,d) form
    f1 : real
        lower bound of frequency band on which the transfer function
        is evaluated
    f2 : real
        upper bound of frequency band on which the transfer function
        is evaluated
    N : int, optional
        number of points where the transfer function is evaluated in the
        interval. Defaults to 100.

    Returns
    -------
    rms : real
        rms value of the discrete time transfer function.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import pydsm
    >>> v = np.sin(np.linspace(0, 20*np.pi, 1024))
    >>> print(pydsm.delsig.rms(v))
    0.7067614298686651

    Notes
    -----
    The discrete-time transer function H is evaluated in the frequency band
    (f1,f2).  Spanning of the bandwidth is linear. Frequencies are normalized
    in the [0, 0.5] interval.

    Warning: the result of the computation is normalized in the number of
    points used for the computation, but not on the frequency range.

    This computation could be practiced much more accurately and possibly
    faster, using algorithms for the numerical computation of integrals.
