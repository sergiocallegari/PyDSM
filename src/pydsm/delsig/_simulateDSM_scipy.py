def ds_quantize(y, n):
    """Quantize a signal according to a given number of levels.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y : real or array of reals
        signal to be quantized (1 sample!). A column vector with more than
        1 row if there are multiple quantizers.
    n : int or vector of ints
        number of quantization levels. Can be a vector to specify multiple
        quantizers, in this case, y must have as many rows as the entries in
        n

    Returns
    -------
    z : real or ndarray
        quantized signal (1 sample!). A column vector with
        more than 1 row if there are multiple quantizers.

    Notes
    -----
    y is quantized to:

    * an odd integer in [-n+1, n-1], if n is even, or
    * an even integer in [-n, n], if n is odd.

    This definition gives the same step height for both mid-riser and
    mid-tread quantizers.
