    n : int
        the number of optimized zeros to return
    opt : int, optional
        flag for optimized zeros, defaults to 1

    Returns
    -------
    zeros : ndarray of reals
        the zeros for the modulator as normalized angular frequencies.

    Notes
    -----
    The zeros are always located on the complex unit circle. As such,
    they are returned as frequencies, not as complex values.

    The zero's frequencies are normalized with respect to the signal
    bandwidth. See also Sec. 4.3.1 in [1]_
