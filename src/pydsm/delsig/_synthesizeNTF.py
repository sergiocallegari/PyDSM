    """
    Synthesizes an NTF for a DS modulator by Schreier's approach.

    Parameters
    ----------
    order : int, optional
        the order of the modulator, defaults to 3
    osr : float, optional
        the oversamping ratio (based on the actual signal bandwidth)
    opt : int or list of floats, optional
        flag for optimized zeros, defaults to 0

        * 0 -> not optimized,
        * 1 -> optimized,
        * 2 -> optimized with at least one zero at band-center,
        * 3 -> optimized zeros (with optimizer)
        * 4 -> same as 3, but with at least one zero at band-center
        * [z] -> zero locations in complex form

    H_inf : real, optional
        max allowed peak value of the NTF. Defaults to 1.5
    f0 : real, optional
        center frequency for BP modulators, or 0 for LP modulators.
        Defaults to 0.
        1 corresponds to the sampling frequency, so that 0.5 is the
        maximum value. Value 0 specifies an LP modulator.

    Returns
    -------
    ntf : tuple
        noise transfer function in zpk form.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    use_optimizer : bool
        Use: True for for optimizing the zeros with a fast optimization code,
        False otherwise. Defaults can be set by changing the function
        ``default_options`` attribute.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        'Frequency f0 must be less than 0.5' if f0 is out of range

        'Order must be even for a bandpass modulator' if the order is
        incompatible with the modulator type.

        'The opt vector must be of length xxx' if opt is used to explicitly
        pass the NTF zeros and these are in the wrong number.

    RuntimeError
        'Cannot synthesize NTF zeros' if the synthesis fails for some
        unspecified reason.

    Warns
    -----
    PyDsmApproximationWarning
        'Creating a lowpass ntf.' if the center frequency is different
        from zero, but so low that a low pass modulator must be designed.

        'Unable to achieve specified H_inf ...' if the desired H_inf
        cannot be achieved.

        'Iteration limit exceeded' if the routine converges too
        slowly.

    Notes
    -----
    This is actually a wrapper function which calls the appropriate version
    of synthesizeNTF, based on the control flag `optimize_NTF` which
    determines whether to use optimization tools.

    Parameter H_inf is used to enforce the Lee stability criterion.

    If osr or H_inf are low, then the NTF is non optimal. Use
    synthesizeChebyshevNTF instead.
