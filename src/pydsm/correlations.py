Correlation utilities (:mod:`pydsm.correlations`)
=================================================

Functions to compute the auto- and cross- correlation between two vectors.

So far only unnormalized (raw) correlations are supported.

.. currentmodule:: pydsm.correlations

Functions
---------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

    raw_acorr  -- raw autocorrelation of a vector
    raw_xcorr  -- raw crosscorrelation of a vector
"""

from __future__ import division, print_function

import numpy as np

import sys
if sys.version_info < (3,):
    range = xrange

__all__ = ["raw_acorr", "raw_xcorr"]


def raw_acorr(x, N):
    """
    Computes the raw autocorrelation of a vector up to lag N.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        1-D sequence to compute the auto-correlation upon
    N : int
        the maximum (positive) lag of the raw auto-correlation to return.

    Returns
    -------
    q : ndarray
        the raw (unnormalized) autocorrelation vector.
        Assuming that m is the length of x
        q(k) = sum_{n=k}^{m-1} x(n) x(n-k) for k = 0 ... N

    Notes
    -----
    The routine does not make any check on the length of x and N. It
    is responsibility of the user to assure that len(x)>=N. In some cases
    (but only in some cases), zero padding is practiced.
    """
    m = len(x)
    q = np.asarray([np.dot(x[k:m], x[0:m-k]) for k in range(N+1)])

def raw_xcorr(x, y, N):
    """
    Computes the raw crosscorrelation between two vectors up to lag N.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        first 1-D vector
    y : array_like
        second 1-D vector
    N : int
        the maximum (positive) lag of the raw cross-correlation to return.

    Returns
    -------
    q : ndarray
        the raw (unnormalized) crosscorrelation vector.
        Assuming that mx and my are the lengths of x and y
        q(k) = sum_{n=k}^{min(mx-1,my+k-1)} x(n) y(n-k) for k = 0 ... N

    Notes
    -----
    the routine does not make any check on the lengths of x, y and N. It
    is responsibility of the user to assure that N<=len(y). In some cases
    (but only in some cases), zero padding is assumed.
