Noise weighting NTF synthesis (:mod:`pydsm.NTFdesign.weighting`)
================================================================

This modules provides code for the synthesis of the modulator NTF, based
on a noise weighting function.

.. currentmodule:: pydsm.NTFdesign.weighting

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

    mult_weightings      -- Product of weighting functions
    q0_weighting         -- Q matrix from a noise weighting function
    ntf_fir_from_q0      -- design FIR NTF from matrix Q
    ntf_hybrid_weighting -- design hybrid NTF from weighting function
    ntf_fir_weighting    -- design FIR NTF from weighting function
