Pytest test runner.

This module implements the ``test()`` function for PyDSM modules and is
based on the NumPy module with the same name

Warnings filtering and other runtime settings should be dealt with in the
``pytest.ini`` file in the repo root. The behavior of the test depends on
whether or not that file is found as follows:

* ``pytest.ini`` is present (develop mode)
    All warnings except those explicitly filtered out are raised as error.
* ``pytest.ini`` is absent (release mode)
    DeprecationWarnings and PendingDeprecationWarnings are ignored, other
    warnings are passed through.

In practice, tests run from the repo are run in development mode from an
inplace build with ``pytest pydsm``.

This module is imported by every subpackage.

        Parameters
        ----------
        label : {'fast', 'full'}, optional
            Identifies the tests to run. When set to 'fast', tests decorated
            with `pytest.mark.slow` are skipped, when 'full', the slow marker
            is ignored.
        verbose : int, optional
            Verbosity value for test outputs, in the range 1-3. Default is 1.
        extra_argv : list, optional
            List with any extra arguments to pass to pytests.
        doctests : bool, optional
            Perform doctests
        coverage : bool, optional
            If True, report coverage. Default is False.
            Requires installation of (pip) pytest-cov.
        durations : int, optional
            If < 0, do nothing, If 0, report time of all tests, if > 0,
            report the time of the slowest `timer` tests. Default is -1.
        tests : test or list of tests
            Tests to be executed with pytest '--pyargs'

        -----
        Each PyDSM module exposes `test` in its namespace to run all tests for
