def mirroredNTF(ntf):
    """Creates a symmetric noise transfer function from a prototype.

    This function takes a prototype single band NTF for a LP modulator
    and returns a symmetric NTF with signal bands at the bottom and at
    the top of the available frequency ranges.

    Note that the way in which the mirroring happens make the resulting
    NTF peak at about the squared value as the peak of the original
    prototype. Hence the prototype should be designed with an H_inf value
    that is the square root of the desired one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ntf : tuple
        input noise tranfer function in zpk form

    Returns
    -------
    ntf2 : tuple
        output noise transfer function in zpk form
